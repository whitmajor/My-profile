          <p> As we look at the world around us it is vastly growing towards the Technology Industry. As the world blossoms towards this field, my passion grew from wanting to obtain more knowledge on where this field will eventually take us. Learning new skills will always be motivation for my career path.I've finally found a skill that I  can practice for hours without no complaints! I love working with others and look forward to future collabarations on new projects.
          <p> Prior to web development, I have studied the Aviation Industry for 5 years and gained experience within the field. Anything technical always spark my interest.
